## Setup Steps:
Before running this notebook, you need to have the necessary Python packages installed. There are two options for this:
1. **Install the packages into a [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda) virtual environment**: create a new conda environment with all the packages you will need using `TOOD: put in the commands to use the .yml file`.
2. **Install the packages directly**: Run the following commands from your terminal:
    * `TODO xarray`
    * `TODO FaIR`
    * `TODO anything else`
