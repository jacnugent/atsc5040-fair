# atsc5040-fair
Demonstration of how to run the FaIR simple energy balance model (https://docs.fairmodel.net/en/latest/index.html) for ATSC 5040. 

## Setup Steps:
Before running this notebook, you need to have the necessary Python packages installed. There are two options for this:
1. **Install the packages into a [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda) virtual environment (recommended)**: create a new conda environment with all the packages you will need using `conda env create -f environment.yaml`. When it is finished installing, run `conda activate atsc5040-fair-env` to activate the new envrionmne.t
2. **Install the packages directly using pip**: You will need pandas, xarray, scipy, and fair. Run the following commands from your terminal:
    * `pip install pandas`
    * `python -m pip install xarray`
    * `pip install scipy`
    * `pip install fair`
